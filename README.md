# PocketPath

## Introduction
PocketPath is a smartphone-based indoor navigation solution, designed to provide users with convenience and user-friendly navigation within complex and large indoor environments.  App users can effortlessly search for their destination within the building, and the app offers the most convenient route to get there. Beyond this basic navigation, the app goes a step further by offering extra location details like operating hours, real-time updates like closures, blockages, or openings, and contact information enriching the indoor navigation experience. Moreover, users have the option to share their live location with others through a provided link, enhancing the app's functionality and user interaction.

## How to Setup the Environment

### Pre-requisite
1. Ensure that your machine has JDK installed, version 17 to 20. This is a mandatory requirement.
2. Install an emulator. Android Studio provides a convenient option.
3. Install an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) suitable for React Native development.
4. Verify that you have set the `$ANDROID_HOME` and `$JAVA_HOME` environment variables before starting the application. You can check this by running `echo $ANDROID_HOME`, which should return a path like `'/Users/sivakajan/Library/Android/sdk'` on macOS.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/Sivakajan-tech/indoor_navigation.git
```
2. Navigate into the cloned repository directory.
```
cd indoor_navigation
```

3. Install all the necessary packages by running:
```
npm install
```
   
4. Start the React Native bundler by running
```
npx react-native start
```
You can now proceed with building and running the application on your emulator or connected device using your preferred IDE.

### Lint Checker.
You need to ensure the `npm run lint` does not have any errors or warnings. You can easily omit this by running `npx eslint --fix .`
