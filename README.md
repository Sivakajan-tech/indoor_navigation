This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

✔ New project is already inside of a Git repo, skipping git init.

  
  Run instructions for Android:
    • Have an Android emulator running (quickest way to get started), or a device connected.
    • cd "/Users/sivakajan/Semester 8/CS4472 Mobile Computing/indoor_navigation" && npx react-native run-android
  
  Run instructions for iOS:
    • cd "/Users/sivakajan/Semester 8/CS4472 Mobile Computing/indoor_navigation/ios"
    
    • Install Cocoapods
      • bundle install # you need to run this only once in your project.
      • bundle exec pod install
      • cd ..
    
    • npx react-native run-ios
    - or -
    • Open indoor_navigation/ios/indoor_navigation.xcodeproj in Xcode or run "xed -b ios"
    • Hit the Run button
    
  Run instructions for macOS:
    • See https://aka.ms/ReactNativeGuideMacOS for the latest up-to-date instructions.
    
## How to setup the envirnment
### Prerequisites
1. Ensure that your machine has JDK installed, version 17 to 20. This is a mandatory requirement.
2. Install an emulator. Android Studio provides a convenient option.
3. Install an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) suitable for React Native development.
4. Verify that you have set the `$ANDROID_HOME` and `$JAVA_HOME` environment variables before starting the application. You can check this by running `echo $ANDROID_HOME`, which should return a path like `'/Users/sivakajan/Library/Android/sdk'` on macOS.

### Guid step by step

1. Clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/Sivakajan-tech/indoor_navigation.git
```
2. Navigate into the cloned repository directory.
```
cd indoor_navigation
```

3. Install all the necessary packages by running:
```
npm install
```
   
4. art the React Native bundler by running
```
npx react-native start
```
You can now proceed with building and running the application on your emulator or connected device using your preferred IDE.
